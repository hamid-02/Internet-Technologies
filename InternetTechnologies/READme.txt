I have created a video game e-Commerce website where I am selling video games for all available platforms. The website will be dynamic because I want to use 
a database using MySQL and PHP. This is to make the website dynamic with also the help of the JavaScript programming language. The use of the programming 
language is to make it responsive, simple and fun to use. The website contains 5 pages in which the user can traverse through to make an imaginary purchase.

The main home page includes the header with 2 columns where there is an image of a gaming image. The paragraph on the left of the page includes a "Shop Now!" 
button in which the user can immediately traverse to the all products page which shows all of the products that I am selling on the website. If you scroll 
down, there will be a featured products section which will show the products that I feel that need featuring. If you scroll down even further, there will 
be a products on offer section. This section will showcase a video game which is, at the moment, popular to play and the video game which is on sale. If you 
scroll even further, here you will see a testimonials section which is people who have purchased from my e-Commerce website and who are happy with their 
video game they bought. Underneath the testimonials section, there are companies and brands that change to their own colours whenever the mouse is hovered 
over the brand images. Throughtout the whole website, to keep a recurring theme within the website, I have created/included a footer section which is split 
into 4 columns which also acts as as free in-house advertising for my other services that I can include within this website.

The products page contains all of the products that I am selling. Currently I am selling 12 video games to the public which are currently the popular video 
games to purchase at this very moment. Each of the 12 products in page and whole website, the user can view the product in much more detail so they can gain 
as much of information as they can before they decide to purchase the video game. The products page also includes a sorting system with 4 different sorting 
options. They are the following: Default Sorting, High to Low, Low to High, and Sorting by Popularity.

The contact us page uses a simple contact form which uses a mailto a href link as it is works as intended and also the call a href link. The contact form 
includes the basic information text fields which the user can fill as they like with no certain requirements. On the right of the contact form, there is a 
simple info box which the user can use to reach me using social media or by calling me or emailing me if they want to get into touch with me. There is also a 
map which is included using an iframe link so it can be updated easily by going on google maps.

The account page has two forms for the login and the registration. The admin will be able to login using the admin login which is: ('admin', 'admin123'), 
this login would allow the admin to access the admin page where they can add, update, delete products or any users that may be wanting access to the website.
The guest or the generic user woul use the following: ('guest', 'guest123'), this login would allow the user to make purchases within the website with the 
add to cart functionality.

** CHANGE DATABASE INFO IN ALL PAGES IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE WEBSITE PROPERLY WITH NO ISSUES. **
